Measure of the abundance and relative frequency of species in a specified area. Species diversity is often used with respect to animal or plant populations in a single stand, but can also be thought of on regional and global scales. For the purposes of biodiversity conservation, spatial scales of species diversity are hierarchical: global diversity is a higher conservation priority than regional diversity, and both are more important than local or stand-level diversity.

It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else. This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.

A new Green's theorem de-ghosting method that simultaneously: (1) avoids a finite difference approximation for the normal derivative of the pressure and, (2) avoids the need for replacing the normal derivative of pressure with the vertical component of particle velocity, thereby avoiding issues that can arise within each of those two assumptions/approaches.

But I dont want my son to see what happens now that he is getting older. He has threatned me and says if I leave he will take my son and I will never see him again. I feel helpless and afraid that I will not be alive a few months later after I leave. He tells me that a womans job is to cook and clean only. I dont know how to leave and I feel guilty if I go eat dinner at my moms or Chilis down the street. He hates my family and tells me I dont need friends and I only need him. Most of my friends stopped speaking with me because he has text them awful things and they get into arguments. I wanted to leave and he was diagnosed with depresseion he said if I left he would commit sucicide and it would be my fault. I am hurt inside and feel like I am never good enough.

About 15 years ago, I read a book that talked about the importance of having a life motto and putting it in your office where you can see it everyday. I thought that was a neat idea and after two weeks, I finally came up with the phrase that embraced my life and continues to inspire me to this day: "If it's not a challenge, it's not worth doing." But I wasn't always this way. I had a great leader in my life that mentored me even when he didn't know I was listening and watching. My brother was that big influence in my life. As we grew up in the "sticks and cornfields" of north central Illinois, he always pushed me to do more than I thought I could. I remember receiving repelling gear from him for Christmas one year. "What can you do with repelling gear in flatland Illinois?" I thought. We decided to repel out of a 70-foot oak tree. We tied the rope to the branch we were standing on and had a free fall for the first 5 feet until the rope caught up. What an exhilarating ride! It took my breath away.

 Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people and people with access and functional needs. Stay upstream, uphill, and upwind! In general, try to go at least one-half mile (usually 8-10 city blocks) from the danger area. Move away from the accident scene and help keep others away. Do not walk into or touch any spilled liquids, airborne mists, or condensed solid chemical deposits. Try not to inhale gases, fumes and smoke. If possible, cover mouth with a cloth while leaving the area. Stay away from accident victims until the hazardous material has been identified. Stop and seek shelter in a permanent building. If you must remain in your car, keep car windows and vents closed and shut off the air conditioner and heater. Close and lock all exterior doors and windows. Close vents, fireplace dampers, and as many interior doors as possible. Turn off air conditioners and ventilation systems.

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the "St. Peter". After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784. Between 1774 and 1800, Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound. These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez, Bucareli Sound, and Cordova. Later, the Russian-American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

Statistics Sweden has studied the green structure in 37 larger urban areas in Sweden, that is, urban areas with at least 30 000 inhabitants as well as the urban area of Visby (Gotland), to cover the largest urban areas in each county. Most of these larger urban areas had a total green structure that exceeded 50 percent of the land area. Only five of 37 urban areas have a share of green structure that was less than 50 percent of the land area, and all of these areas were in Skåne. The lowest share of green space was in the urban area of Landskrona where only 43 percent of the land consisted of green space. On average, about one-fourth of urban areas' green space was connected to private gardens and thus not accessible to the public. 
Luleå, Landskrona and Örebro had the largest share of green space accessible to the public, over 80 percent. This can be compared to the corresponding share in Täby which was 51 percent.

I think it's really important that this not just be a regulatory process but what this country really needs is a bipartisan consensus, a deep, strong consensus, so that energy policy is not subject to the whims of every two years or every four years. So of course the Obama administration will have that opportunity and there are some recommendations that will have an impact and will be involved in that process, but ultimately we do think that both parties have to come together. That production is a bridge for the Democratic party to get some of the incentives and efficiency and alternative vehicles that they have been promoting, and that alternative vehicles and R&D are a bridge to getting the production that Republicans have been promoting. Because unless we're doing all those things, and we start doing them now, five years, 10 years, 20 years from now we'll look back and we'll say, " Geez , I wish we had done that then." So I really think, yes, the regulatory process is important, but we really have to once again come together after a few years, I'd say, of a little less bipartisanship in this area that we'd seen previously and find that again and push forward a strong energy consensus.

Pentagon revealed this day that ISAF Commander and U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Allen, is under investigation for inappropriate communication with the woman who should have received threatening e-mails from Paula Broadwell, as CIA chief Petraeus had a relationship. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta reported the news to the journalists who were in his flight from Honolulu to Perth in Australia, and said the FBI notified the incident on Sunday. The woman Allen in all probability has communicated with, Jill Kelley, is also the woman who notified the FBI about what she perceived as threatening e-mails from Broadwell, and thus led to the investigation that revealed the relationship between Petraeus and Broadwell. It is not clear what or how this communication between Kelley and Allen have been, but the American federals are investigating between 20 000 and 30 000 pages of e-mails and other documents, which likely has been sent between Allen and Kelley between 2010 and 2012, according to one of Panetta employees.

It would weaken a key element of European policy. The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned. There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition. In any case, the Commission's proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties. There was no majority for this at the time. Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.

It is a debate about the potential of GMOs for good and their potential for risk, and how you manage that risk. You cannot abolish risk because it is part of our natural environment. We cannot prevent all man-made risk because that would end scientific progress. But we must respond to public concern about the potential and unknown dangers to our environment, to our food chain and to our health. I believe there are four areas where we must act to reassure the public. I believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology.

Collaborative research from the Institute of Development Studies states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to development". The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.

As essential as sharks are to the oceans, they are being dramatically overfished, primarily to fill market demand for their valuable fins. Shark fins are used for shark fin soup, a luxury food item sometimes served at weddings and banquets. Tens of millions of sharks are killed each year, many of which are targeted for their fins. Many shark populations have been decimated by as much as 90%. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports that a full 1/3 of shark species face extinction.

The next thing I know I'm back in the living room! Flat on my back. My oldest son – who was two and a half at the time – was standing over my face. He said, "Daddy, that was funny. Do it again!"  Normally I'd laugh, but I couldn't talk. In fact I was – in the immortal words of Led Zeppelin – dazed and confused. Just then the door flew open and my next door neighbor ran in and asked if everyone was OK. He saw me on the floor and started to assess. (He was a Sheriff's Officer.) He started asking me a bunch of questions and when I finally spoke I asked, "What happened?" He said, "You must have been struck by lightning. I saw your house get hit. That's why I came over." I sat there for a few moments and finally declared, "There's no way I got struck by lightning.  I'M A METEOROLOGIST !" (I really said that.) Luckily, I survived. No major damage except for a burn on my back where (we surmised) the lightning went up and out of me. The real irony? I was on the Duval County Board of Lightning Safety. I was lucky enough to along pass this story (and act it out) to a couple of thousand school classrooms over my 20+years on television. Every so often I will run into one of those students who is now all grown up.  To a person, they all remember "The Lightning Story" and my lightning safety lessons: When you hear thunder, go inside. When you're inside: No baths or showers, stay off any non-cellular phones and don't hang on to any metal window frames.

At around 5:45 yesterday I stopped to pick up some cleaning supplies and dinner about 4 blocks from my apartment on my way home from work. I decided to take the bus home and waited with a mixed group of about 8 people. A man approached me and offered to "keep me warm" and I ignored him. He watched me for about 5 minutes and then grabbed my arm, insisting it was too cold for me outside. I said "Please don't touch me. I don't know you." He started screaming at me, saying things like "As big as you are? You're lucky anyone is touching you!" I kept ignoring it. He walked up to the young man next to me and said loudly "I'm gonna go with her and show her not to disrespect men like that!" No one said anything so I went inside a nearby shop and asked to speak with a manager.

To them, he seems increasingly eager to do deals with the most extreme Islamists in opposition to all their progressive dreams for their country. Yet in August, when President Karzai flagrantly stole the presidential election, President Obama telephoned to congratulate him and the U.S. officially pronounced the fraudulent election results "good enough."

We are constantly being faced with all kinds of states of affairs, blockades and such like, and I believe it would be of great benefit if more objective information on future changes could be provided so that we could perhaps prevent a few mistakes from being made, as might have happened in the case of the Titanic.

I sketch my ideas out and make sure to do as many variations of it as I can. I also find it very useful to get input from the people around me at this stage when the idea is still fresh and at its infant stage. Around this point, I start choosing the best few concepts and proceed to creating art for the game. I use Photoshop to draw out and color the art, and once that is done, I export it out and get it ready to be put into the game. From here on, it's mostly seeing what works and what does not. For example, the launcher for the missile looked good on paper, but when it was put into the game, it was a little too big and bright.

I prefer wax foundation for my supers and plastic foundation for the hive bodies. The plastic comes in white or black. I have tried both and prefer black as it seems the bees draw the wax better from the black as compared to the white.

In late July, Republican senators such as John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnel have come out in their opposition to the 14th Amendment claiming it does not extend to children of the undocumented. Of course this has been proven false in two Supreme Court cases such as United States V. Wong Kim Ark and Plyer V. Doe, but the imperialists are playing their usual card of historical amnesia. With the attack on the 14th Amendment, the reactionaries are making it more clear that immigration and "obeying the law" was never on their agenda. They are in fear of the growing Latino population and the children of immigrants, who unlike their parents have the power to vote and organize, and wield political power. The politics are more than obvious for us. The right-wing's hypocrisy here knows no bounds. On the one hand they claim immigrants pay no taxes and are a "burden," but the fact of the matter is that statistics do not lie. Immigrants plug more into the economy and social security than they could ever take out and benefit from.

The MDGs have been the most successful global anti-poverty push in history. The MDG framework process has highlighted a number of keys to success. This includes: 1) reliable statistics to design interventions, measure progress and enhance accountability; 2) the importance of linking goals and targets with investments in data production at country level; and 3) building national capacity for data collection and reporting. Indeed, data quality has greatly improved in recent years. Yet, we all know there is an urgent need to do more to further enhance data collection, dissemination and analysis. Going forward, the role of data and statistics will be critical. This is particularly since the Post-2015 development agenda embraces the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic development, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. That is why the Secretary-General's High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda has called for a new data revolution. Better data and statistics will help governments reach the most marginalised and the vulnerable, track progress and make sure decisions are evidence-based. They can also strengthen accountability. In the process, we need to find ways to garner broader participation and resources from international agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector and academia. In addition to traditional statistics, we need to leverage new, non-traditional data such as big data. The data revolution should build on innovative initiatives in technology and capacity building, especially at the country level. It should also expand existing monitoring frameworks towards sustainable architecture for development data. The role of national statistical systems will be fundamental. In closing, I encourage you to work in an open and transparent manner, engaging with non-traditional counterparts, not least civil society. Outreach will be key to the legitimacy of this work. You should also amplify the voices of developing countries where the data gaps are larger and where human and institutional capacities are lagging.

The world of small, nimble firms, of quick-witted brokers of global production packages, that some happily expect cannot be the basis of stable social and political life. Such changes cannot be wholly resisted, but they can be qualified, otherwise the connection between production and employment and between production and nationality will be severed, with dismal consequences. There have to be barriers against this tidal flow of money, goods, and people washing back and forth over the eroding stumps of national economies and polities. Weak economies make for weak governments, uncertain of the allegiance of their citizens, which is where the link between our economic problem and the problems both of supranational co-operation and of intervention lies. Not so paradoxically, confident, reasonably strong nations are better members of federations than weak ones. The former feel they can fight their corner whatever the legal framework, while the latter fasten on legalities in panicky self defence.
